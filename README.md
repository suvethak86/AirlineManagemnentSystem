Imagine an airport. What comes to mind first? A large terminal, information screens, long lines, baggage claim belts, and planes getting ready for takeoff. Airports run on tight schedules, managing staff and processing passengers while keeping an eye on every detail. Automation helps speed up these tasks and improve service quality. We've applied best practices to modernize airline operations and used our skills for Merlot Aero's advanced airline management. In this article, we will explore key airport operations and how integrated software solutions can make them easier, along with a look at some popular airport management systems from top vendors. The article has two parts: an overview of key airport operations and a review of widely used solutions. If you already know the basics, feel free to skip to the second part.
